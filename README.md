The most dysfunctional virtual pet simulator ever created. Because regular Tamagotchi was too wholesome.

## What Fresh Hell Is This?

Remember Tamagotchi? This is like that, but your pet can:
- 💩 Poop everywhere and live in filth
- 🍺 Develop substance addictions
- 💸 Drown in crippling debt with 10% compound interest
- 😔 Fall into depression and refuse to function
- 📱 Become addicted to their phone and ignore you
- 🎰 Gamble away all their money
- 💔 Get dumped by their partner
- 🤬 Go through a rebellious teenage phase and hate you
- 💀 Die in multiple horrifying ways

It's basically a life simulator. You know, for fun!

## Features That Will Haunt You

## Why Does This Exist?

Someone asked me to make it "more chaotic" and I took it personally.

This started as a cute Tamagotchi clone and evolved into a psychological horror simulator that accidentally became a commentary on modern life.

The fact that it's actually fun to play is concerning for all of us.

## Life Lessons Learned

According to the game: **0**

Actual lessons:
- Debt compounds faster than you think
